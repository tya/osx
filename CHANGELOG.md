## v2.0.1

 * Remove the dependency on 'stdlib'. Leftovers from development. That isn't ready to ship.

## v2.0.0

 * Initial import with history from jtimberman/mac_os_x-cookbook
 * Rename of cookbook from 'mac_os_x' to 'osx' and resultant resource/provider alterations.
 * Move all recipe values into attributes. Defaults work for me. Override as you please.
